# Covid-19 Exploratory Data Anlysis Project

##  Introduction
This is an SQL Data Exploratory Project using the COvid 19 Dataset.
This project aims at showcasing hands-on experience in utilizing Microsoft SQL Server for data analytics. Additionally, it will also aid ongoing endeavors to understand and combat the COVID-19 pandemic through data-driven insights. üåü

## Data Source:
The data is directly downlaoded from  used in this project is a modified microsoft dataset known as Financial Samples;  
* Download Directly from Website [DownloadCovidDatadriectly](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
* CovidDeaths [DownloadCovidDeathfromGooglesheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KI8JwXroSF7M5SkrE10FDMADZ1HTO44p/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=114068862415751566917&rtpof=true&sd=true)
* CovidVaccinations [DownloadCovidVaccinationsfromGooglesheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18zlI4JWegb19ArmLEK6KbjHboZQCK3UR/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=114068862415751566917&rtpof=true&sd=true)

## SQL and Analytics Technical Skills showcased:
+ Project Planning and Documentation
+ Joins
+ CTE's
+ Temp Tables and Creating Views 
+ Windows Functions
+ Aggregate Functions
+ Converting Data Types
  
## Data Ingestion and EDA Process:
The downloaded dataset was loaded into SQL server while all other ETL processes follows afterwards.
The comsplete EDA process can be gotten from the project codes here [Covid-19Project](https://github.com/Abdur-RasheedAde/MySQLProjects/blob/main/SQLProject.sql)

## Report Design and Visualization
The project was visualized using Tableau Public
Link shall be available soon!!! Watch Out

## Conclusions 
1. SQL is one of the leading language in Data Analysis essentially used for the EDA and at higher level, Data Engineering and Data Science.
2. It has different flavors like SQL Server, Postgress, MySQL, OracleSQL and so on
3. It is also an awesome tool for Data warehousing and ETL process while data visualization can be done with other tools services like PowerBI or Tableau or other cloud based ones like AWSQuicksight, Looker...

Thanks for taking time to go through this report! and I am open to collaborate with you on any Data Engineering projects exploring SQL on cloud big data platforms especially Azure, AWS, GCP and Databricks, you can always reach me on adeoyerasheed30@gmail.com Ciao ü§ù
